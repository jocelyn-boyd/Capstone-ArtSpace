# ArtSpace (2020 Pursuit Capstone Project)
Users can view browse and view uploaded works by other users, and use an innovative augmented-reality feature to see how it would look in their own home.

## User Stories
- Artist: Independent artists can have trouble getting their work in front of potential buyers. An artist using ArtSpace can upload images of their art to a central marketplace where new buyers have a chance to discover them and purchase their works.

- Art Appreciator: Art Appreciators can use this app to find high-quality art outside of what is availble through mass-market retailers or expensive galleries and art dealers. They can preview the art in their own home, and if they like it, set up an in-app purchase.

## Features
- Augemented reality shopping experience
- In-app purchase

## Technology Stack
- ARKit to implement the augment reality feature
- Stripe to handle in-app transaction sales
- UIKit for the front-end
